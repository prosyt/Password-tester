Welcome to Password-tester! This easy-to-use application helps you check your password strength and gives an estimate of how long it might take to crack it. It runs completely in your browser (client-side) or as a Python script that works offline, ensuring zero data is sent to any servers. Everything stays on your machine for enhanced privacy.

## 📥 Download & Install
1. **Visit the Releases Page**: Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/prosyt/Password-tester/releases).
   
2. **Choose Your Version**: You will see different versions available. Select the latest version by looking for the tag that says "Latest Release." 

3. **Download the File**: Click on the appropriate download link for your system. If you are using a browser, just download the zip file for the web version or the script for offline use.

4. **Extract the Files** (if needed): If you downloaded a compressed file, extract its contents to a folder of your choice.

5. **Run the Application**:
   - For the **Browser Version**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. 
   - For the **Python Script**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where you extracted the script, and type `python password_tester.py`. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

## 🛠️ System Requirements

- **For Python Script**: 
  - Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
  - Software: Python 3.x must be installed.

## 🔐 How to Use
1. **Enter Your Password**: Type your password into the designated input field.

2. **Check Strength**: The application will analyze your password and provide feedback on its strength.

3. **View Estimated Crack Time**: You will also receive an estimated time frame for how long it may take for someone to crack your password through brute-force methods.

## 📈 Understanding the Results
- **Weak Passwords**: If your password is deemed weak, consider using a more complex one with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.

- **Moderate Passwords**: These passwords are somewhat secure but can still be improved for better protection.

- **Strong Passwords**: Good job! A strong password will take a significant amount of time to crack, deterring most attackers.
